Payloads that I've tested, added to, and have found useful. 

GoodUSB - Downloads and executes ClamAV a free and open source antivirus software on Windows

LinuxExfil - Finds and copies files that you put into it onto a drive called exfil 

LoveUrFriendThankYou - Like a super crazy RickRoll with for Windows with Scheduled-Task's and notepad hints to stop the chaos self destructs and removes all traces after 2 hours. Main songs are "Where is the Love" - Black Eyed Peas, "Why Can't We Be Friends" - War, "Thank You For Being A Friend" - Andrew Gold. Secondary song that launches when you close the Youtube window "Ain't No Sunshine" - Bill Withers. Also unmutes system volume and turns it to 60% everytime a video is launched.

LoveUrFriendUrWelcome - If you want to remove everything sooner than 2 hours after running LoveUrFriendThankYou and cant figure out how to remove the tasks with the notepad hints that are launched on intervals run this.

PowerShellAdmin - Use this script to launch any script that requires PowerShell Administrator privileges. Very good starting point for your own scripts.

WindowsExfilWifi - Run this on windows computers to get a print out .txt file that has saved SSID names and Wifi Passwords in plain text. Very useful for sharing passwords.

I know I'm asking a lot here but I'm broke, but I'm starting to be less broken. I was layed off by the UAW last year and now I'm living with off savings and with family. Like I said I'm broke, I'm considering cashing in my 401k to pay for OffSec OSCP Cert school and test. I would appreciate not even a coffee but an Energy Drink. Anything helps and for just $2.50 you can help this tired man get through another lab or troubleshoot another bug.
