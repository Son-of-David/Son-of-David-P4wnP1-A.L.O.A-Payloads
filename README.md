LoveUrFriendThankYou - Like a super crazy RickRoll with for Windows with Scheduled-Task's and notepad hints to stop the chaos self destructs and removes all traces after 2 hours. Main songs are "Where is the Love" - Black Eyed Peas, "Why Can't We Be Friends" - War, "Thank You For Being A Friend" - Andrew Gold. Secondary song that launches when you close the Youtube window "Ain't No Sunshine" - Bill Withers. Also unmutes system volume and turns it to 60% everytime a video is launched.

LoveUrFriendUrWelcome - If you want to remove everything sooner than 2 hours after running LoveUrFriendThankYou and cant figure out how to remove the tasks with the notepad hints that are launched on intervals run this.
